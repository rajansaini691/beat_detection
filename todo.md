## TODOs 
* [ ] When download is complete, run mv ~/Downloads/cal10kthingy.tar.gz .
* [ ] Download the lakh MIDI file data set thing
* [ ] Split the each aligned wav file into a series of fourier vectors labeled "percussion" and "no percussion", using the MIDI file as a guide
* [ ] We want better beat matching; use percussion from the MIDI to create a correspondence with the audio


## Far future
* If this ever amounts to anything, see [this page](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/musicsim/uspop2002.html) and [this page](http://millionsongdataset.com/) for citing purposes

### Reproducibility
* The mp3 samples are from [here](http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/additional-datasets/) and the MIDI files and tools for audio alignment are from [here](https://github.com/craffel/midi-dataset)
