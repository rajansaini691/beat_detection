## TODOs 
* [x] Scrape ground truth data from AcousticBrainz dataset

* [ ] Get wav files from youtube
    * Need to determine best search pattern so that the first result provides the
      desired track

* [ ] Split each wav file into little pieces, where each piece belongs to one of 2 categories:
  beat and no beat
* [ ] Visually render beats alongside a playing track so we can validate ground truth data
