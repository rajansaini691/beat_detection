## TODOs 
* [ ] Write a script to download each video and perform alignment
* [ ] Split the each aligned wav file into a series of fourier vectors labeled "percussion" and "no percussion", using the MIDI file as a guide
* [ ] We want better beat matching; use percussion from the MIDI to create a correspondence with the audio


## Far future
* If this ever amounts to anything, see [this page](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/musicsim/uspop2002.html) and [this page](http://millionsongdataset.com/) for citing purposes

### Reproducibility
* The MIDI files and tools for audio alignment are from [here](https://github.com/craffel/midi-dataset)
